On instagram or twitter, I see one of the people I follow has posted a link to a website called www.flymethere.com. I go to this website and on the landing page there are photos from recommended bloggers with flight prices to the places where the photographs were taken. I sign in with my instagram or twitter credentials and I click the button that asks me if the website can use my location.

At the top of the screen is a section which says "I'm thinking..." immediately below this are two sliders which have location and time on them. Beneath the sliders are thumbnail tiles which have photographs from either people I follow or recommended bloggers. The photographs have annotations like "Oslo from Â£35 pounds". On slider 1, the options are: 'Anywhere', 'Somewhere nearby', 'Out of town' and 'A bit further afield'. On slider 2, the options are: 'Anytime', 'A weekend this month' and 'A weekend next month'.

Both sliders are initially set to Anywhere and Anytime. When I alter the position of the location slider, it filters the photographs that appear below based on the distance between the geotag and the position of the user. When I alter the position of the time slider, it updates the cost of the flights.

I click through and make impulse flight purchases/get inspiration in ways that would not have been possible if I had not been linked through to the website. When I click on a flight/location/photo combination I like, I am able to share easily on my own social media.
